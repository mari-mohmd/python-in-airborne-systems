# In Python, spaces and tabs function differently for indentation. You
# can choose to use either spaces or tabs consistently for indentation
# within a block of code. Mixing spaces and tabs within the same block
# of code will lead to a TabError

    # This example uses different types of indentation (spaces and tabs).
    # which will cause a TabError.
